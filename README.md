- **Form Validation**: Ensures robust user input handling
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless functions for scalable backend

## Why I Built This

This project represents my exploration of modern AI integration patterns and demonstrates my ability to:

1. **Architect scalable solutions** using serverless technologies
2. **Integrate complex APIs** while maintaining excellent user experience
3. **Handle real-time data** with proper loading states and error handling
4. **Design intuitive interfaces** that work across all device types
5. **Write maintainable code** with TypeScript and modular architecture

## Development Journey

The project evolved through several iterations, each teaching valuable lessons about full-stack development and AI integration. Key challenges I overcame include optimizing audio processing for web browsers, switching from the Web Speech API to Deepgram for TTS, implementing robust error handling for AI services, and creating seamless user interactions.
